Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

    <Title>Gene expression differences between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in human NSCLC</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE10245</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>18486272</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be classified into the major subtypes adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) subtypes. Although explicit molecular, histological and clinical characteristics have been reported for both subtypes, no specific therapy exists so far. However, the characterization of suitable molecular targets holds great promises to develop novel therapies in NSCLC. In the present study, global gene expression profiling of 58 human high grade NSCLC specimens revealed large transcriptomic differences between AC and SCC subtypes: More than 1.700 genes were found to be differentially expressed.
Keywords: disease subtype analysis
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The NSCLC patient collective was composed of the histological subtype adenocarcinoma (n=40) and squamous cell carcinoma (n=18). We subjected gene expression profiles of 40 AC and 18 SCC samples into further analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all 58 NSCLC tumors using the 500 most variably expressed transcripts revealed two different clusters, which were strongly associated with the histological subtypes AC and SCC of NSCLC. Our result indicated that the major impact on global transcriptional changes was due to the NSCLC histology.
